# Data description

In this README, I provide a description of the datasets included in DeepSurvK. These datasets are the ones that were used in [DeepSurv's original paper](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-018-0482-1) and were obtained directly from the [original repository](https://github.com/jaredleekatzman/DeepSurv/tree/master/experiments/data).

Notice that if data are loaded as a NumPy array, you will only get the numerical values. In this case, the order of the columns correspond to the order of the variables described here. If data are loaded as a pandas DataFrame, you will also get the column headers.

:warning: [There might be some inconsistencies](https://github.com/jaredleekatzman/DeepSurv/issues/55) between the data reported in the original papers and the data included in DeepSurv (and therefore here). Moreover, these data consisted originally of only the numeric values. This made it hard to tell which values correspond to which feature. I obtained the variable names after researching the original sources of the data, as well as other studies that have been published using these datasets. I did my best, but unfortunately I cannot guarantee that these are 100% correct. For more information, please take a look at the suggested references.


## `metabric.h5`
| Variable name | Description | Units | Possible values  |
|---------------|-------------|-------|------------------|
| `gene1` | Gene 1 | ? | Continuous             |
| `gene2` | Gene 2 | ? | Continuous             |
| `gene3` | Gene 3 | ? | Continuous             |
| `gene4` | Gene 4 | ? | Continuous             |
| `radio` | Radiotherapy | - | 0 - No <br> 1 - Yes             |

:warning: `gene1`, `gene2`, `gene3`, and `gene4` presumably correspond to gene indicators or MKI67, EGFR, PGR, and ERBB2. However, it is hard to tell which one belongs to which. Therefore, their names here are kept generic.

:warning: [Kvamme et al.](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume20/18-424/18-424.pdf) report that DeepSurv's version of the data (and therefore also this one) "is actually a case-control data set, meaning it contains multiple replications of some individuals". Apparently this was overlooked originally. I include this dataset for the sake of completion, but keep this in mind if you are using it.
